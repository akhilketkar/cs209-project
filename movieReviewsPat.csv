12 Years a Slave,"[""The cumulative emotional effect is devastating: the final scenes are as angry, as memorable, as overwhelming as anything modern cinema has to offer."", ""So overpowering is this film's simple, horrible, and almost entirely true story that it's hard to get enough distance on 12 Years a Slave to poke at its inner workings."", ""Every scene of 12 Years a Slave, and almost every shot, conveys some penetrating truth about America's original sin."", ""The power of McQueen's movie is in its declaratory style: This happened. That is all, and that is everything."", ""It is a film that necessity and education demand seeing."", ""It provokes recognition in us of the very heart of darkness. It makes the unimaginable imaginable."", ""\""12 Years a Slave\"" isn't easy to watch, and it shouldn't be; it's one man's tragedy, but it's also the tragedy of countless thousands of souls beaten down, literally and metaphorically."", ""The film is both brutal to watch and stunning to contemplate, powerfully challenging audiences - particularly white audiences - to examine their consciences."", ""Slavery is revealed for the unrelenting horror that it was. About time."", ""One of the best and most courageous films of the year."", ""12 Years a Slave is at times difficult to watch but always impossible to turn away from."", ""This is not medicine for America to swallow; it's filmmaking of the highest caliber."", ""\""12 Years a Slave\"" lays out an institution so twisted and wrong that its honest portrayal has been avoided for centuries. Yes, it's dark and brutal. It needs to be."", ""One of the finest historical movies ever made."", ""But the much talked-about 12 Years a Slave is more than a beautifully shot art piece. It's history made violently real."", ""Other movies and books have gone here, but few so far and with such overwhelming clarity of purpose."", ""The film offers a formidable indictment of the cruelty of which human beings are capable."", ""12 Years a Slave is likely the most painful, clear-eyed feature ever made about American slavery. In that light, it almost seems faint praise to add that it will also likely prove to be the best film of the year."", ""It is Ejiofor - bewildered, sorely tested, morally towering - whose staggered dignity anchors the film."", ""Steve McQueen's 12 Years a Slave, written by John Ridley and starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, is a necessary corrective to the antics of Django Unchained, not to mention Mandingo and its ilk."", ""12 Years a Slave, British director Steve McQueen's antebellum Southern drama, sets a new standard in realistically depicting American slavery."", ""A brutally powerful and emotionally devastating film that takes great pains to rip any lingering vestiges of romanticism from America's most shameful institution."", ""Remarkable."", ""\""12 Years a Slave\"" offers no false Hollywood catharsis along with its muted happy ending, because we're not free from the curse of slavery yet. Looking at it, as it really was, is a start."", ""When a director who never ever blinks takes on a horrific subject, a nightmare in broad daylight is the inevitable result. Welcome, if that is the right word, to the world of \""12 Years a Slave.\"""", ""The harrowing 12 Years a Slave is a mesmerizing period drama for the ages."", ""It seems certain to transcend the movie realm and become a new reference point in contemporary culture-a defining vision of what slavery looked like, and felt like, in the U.S. before the Civil War."", ""McQueen doesn't go in for a lot of flash edits or self-conscious visual flourishes to put viewers at ease; rather, he invites the audience to sit with him as he gazes, amazed, at man's inhumanity to man ..."", ""A film this good, and this quietly distinctive in its style, is always welcome."", ""A harrowing, unforgettable drama that doesn't look away from the reality of slavery and, in so doing, helps us all fully, truly confront it."", ""\""12 Years a Slave\"" works on so many levels -- some topical, some timeless -- that it's almost impossible to count them."", ""You won't be able to tuck this powder keg in the corner of your mind and forget it. What we have here is a blistering, brilliant, straight-up classic."", ""Channeling the evils of human bondage through the experiences of one weary figure, McQueen has constructed another intensely physical character study about a man trapped in his own flesh."", ""The genius of \""12 Years a Slave\"" is its insistence on banal evil, and on terror, that seeped into souls, bound bodies and reaped an enduring, terrible price."", ""Slavery here is not only a great moral darkness but a sweeping canvas for depicting the emotional deformities of the people who enforced and exploited the practice."", ""The film truly belongs to Ejiofor, whose big, soulful eyes seem to register so many things at once: Shock, pain, grit, determination, abject despair at times, cautious hope at others - and always, dignity."", ""Aside from a characteristically nuanced lead performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor... it's a picture that stays more than a few safe steps away from anything so dangerous as raw feeling."", ""If the best films hold you in a captive vise, entertain you, keep you spellbound and teach you something at the same time, then 12 Years a Slave is outstanding-brave, courageous and unforgettable."", ""Brave performances throughout this magnificent film."", ""12 Years a Slave is easily the greatest feature film ever made about American slavery."", ""It's smashingly effective as melodrama. But McQueen's directorial voice-cold, stark, deterministic-keeps it from attaining the kind of grace that marks the voice of a true film artist."", ""McQueen and Ridley seem determined to obliterate any lingering Gone With the Wind-inspired notions that the antebellum South was a place of grace and charm, or that slavery was, in the euphemism of the day, merely a \""peculiar institution.\"""", ""Believe the Oscar buzz. Britain's Steve McQueen (Hunger, Shame) nails the horror of America's slavery shame but also finds humanity in one man's determination to free himself and return to his family."", ""It's not too soon to call 12 Years a Slave a great film-ruined, tremulously sad, surreal in its evil."", ""In the epic form of 12 Years a Slave, his most approachable, emotional film, McQueen escalates the tension."", ""12 Years a Slave is a movie about a life that gets taken away, and that's why it lets us touch what life is."", ""A strong, involving, at times overstated telling of an extraordinary life story."", ""This epic account of an unbreakable soul makes even Scarlett O'Hara's struggles seem petty by comparison."", ""Northup's story was a true, terrible thing, and by virtue of telling it, the burdens of all American slaves are unflinchingly realized by Ejiofor and McQueen alike.""]"
127 Hours,"["""", ""It's an incredible performance by Franco, walking the line between what once was enthusiasm but now is manic desperation."", ""At the end, we stagger like Ralston from the dark into the light. We might have both our arms left, but our nerves are just as terrorised."", ""Boyle is such a gifted filmmaker that, in his hands, 127 Hours is genuinely -- and unsentimentally -- inspirational."", ""Boyle has always been an exceptionally stylish director, and, despite its limited setting, 127 Hours is a marvel of visual eye candy."", ""Directed and co-written by Danny Boyle in a style that travels from ecstatic to nerve-wracking and back, this is a film about perseverance, strength and the importance of always letting people know where you're going."", ""The nightmare becomes a tribute to Ralston's bravery -- without casting him as a hero. He just got tired of waiting to die and decided to live."", ""[It] will blow you away -- for its audacity; for James Franco's performance; for the way that, by the end, it leaves you feeling connected to the strangers sitting next to you, and happier to be part of humankind."", ""Shiver-making moments aside, in a important way 127 Hours suffers from the filmmaker's lack of nerve, a reluctance to let the audience taste Ralston's dread and the expectation of a slow, absurd death."", ""In his impressive follow-up to Slumdog Millionaire, the Academy Award-winning director honors the lure of solitude while at the same time celebrating the beautiful necessity of other people."", ""Franco is a remarkably engaging actor - a prerequisite here - but Boyle, understandably, tricks up his predicament with a slew of Ralston's imaginings and fantasies and swaddles everything in a throbbing synthopop score."", ""Aside from an exhilarating opening and a gruesome climax, the movie isn't all that rich emotionally; all the visual razzle-dazzle winds up serving a pat lesson about people needing other people."", ""It's a movie worth seeing, even when it's barely watchable."", ""\""127 Hours,\"" about an unimaginably unbearable experience, is pretty much an unbearable experience of its own."", ""The latest from Danny Boyle is actually an ode to survival, a bracing story of man and nature and an exhilarating sensory experience. It's my favorite movie so far this year."", ""How do you make a movie about immobility? For a hyperactive stylist like Boyle, whose movies are at best thrillingly kinetic and at worst represent death by a thousand cuts, the solution turns out to be absurdly simple. He heads inward."", ""From such harrowing beginnings, it's rather awesome what an entertaining film Danny Boyle has made with \""127 Hours.\"""", ""Boyle's style is never less than energizing, as it manages to keep this incredibly cramped space interesting."", ""As Franco goes from fearful to resigned to resentful of the spot he's in, we're absolutely hooked."", ""Like all great movies, \""127 Hours\"" takes us on a memorable journey. Which is not easy when 90 percent of the movie takes place with a virtually immobile hero in a very cramped setting."", ""Boyle's skill at wringing physical and emotional reactions from his audience is impressive; watching 127 Hours is, as intended, an experience of grueling intensity."", ""Danny Boyle pumps every frame of 127 Hours with cinematic adrenaline that declares war on the dull gravity of docudrama. And James Franco does the best, most natural and nuanced acting of his career to date, lacing terror with bracing humor."", ""In the end, \""127 Hours\"" is one man's incredible, unforgettable journey; it took the extraordinary alchemy of Boyle and Franco to also make it ours."", ""To say that this movie gets under your skin is only barely a figure of speech. It pins you down, shakes you up and leaves you glad to be alive."", ""127 Hours may be occasionally overdirected, but it's never under-felt... and more importantly, Franco's work goes a long way toward making Ralston's story live."", ""The setting may seem constricting, but Boyle captures the intensity of Ralston's experience in a swift, agonizing, defiantly cinematic 90 minutes."", ""Sleek and stylish, harrowing yet heartening, Danny Boyle and James Franco bring their best picture to the big screen."", ""127 Hours becomes the one-man Franco show, and the actor gives a tour-de-force performance."", ""Fraught with tension, yet never claustrophobic, 127 Hours is a phenomenal piece of work in which a fine actor and an innovatively cinematic director join forces to keep you gasping for oxygen all the way."", ""It's a crazy stunt of a movie, the kind of dare that only Oscar-winners get to blow their goodwill on. And still, Boyle might have bested himself again."", ""A passionate, bloody argument for engagement with the world."", ""127 Hours is unflinching in its depiction of what constitutes the \""will to live.\"""", ""Gripping, thrilling, excruciating, inspirational. One of the best movies of the year."", ""127 Hours offers a daunting challenge to a filmmaker: How do you rivet an audience when your protagonist can't even move? The answer is that there's an awesome freedom to Danny Boyle's filmmaking."", ""It's a coming-of-age story -- blunt, mythic, gut-wrenching."", ""Boyle turns the near-death tale into a riveting re-enactment that will keep audiences squirming in their seats."", ""Franco is up to every bit of Boyle's challenge, capturing Aron's transition from clownish outdoorsman and party boy to an introspective chronicler of his own impending demise and a visionary lunatic."", ""Mr. Franco is simply terrific, and Mr. Boyle's trademark exuberance creates a dizzying succession of images that get the movie not only out of the canyon but into its hero's mind."", ""Boyle is such a gifted director that he overcomes the obstacles and might even match the commercial success of his earlier Oscar winner."", ""[Franco's] take on Ralston feels both credible and compelling; few actors could have made us care so much, or disappeared so completely into the role.""]"
2 Guns,"[""Washington and Wahlberg have a good time robbing banks and blowing up buildings and barreling through military security checkpoints and double-crossing people and shooting each other because none of it really means anything."", ""That a movie this fleet and lean succumbs to action-blockbuster bloat in the home stretch is both disappointing and predictable, although the director deserves credit for keeping the climactic shootouts slick and spatially coherent."", ""Mark Wahlberg reunites with Contraband director Baltasar Kormakur for an action movie that's even more cynical and sadistic than its predecessor."", ""In this star vehicle for Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg, the headlights are on full beam but the engine is struggling in second gear."", ""Beyond ridiculous but always entertaining. Washington and Wahlberg are terrific."", ""The biggest guns this action flick brandishes are stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg who have very different acting styles that work surprisingly well together."", ""It's essentially a buddy-cop romp with the usual assortment pack of graphic gruesomeness."", ""An unremarkable, standard-issue shoot-em-up that rests entirely on the charisma of its two stars."", ""Banter, banter, banter. It's such fun being a tough guy and killing people."", ""In a summer when so many of the hype-heavy movies turned out to be big-budget bores, it's refreshing when a movie like 2 Guns achieves its admittedly modest ambitions."", ""2 Guns slops over with instantly over-familiar ingredients like bantering criminal and/or crime-fighting buddies, a loathsome Mexican drug lord, and a femme vitale and femme fatale rolled into one comely dame."", ""Though individual set pieces are well done, the film inevitably leaves an empty taste behind it once it's done."", ""2 Guns loses its charm amid multiple incidents of torture and brutality, including animal cruelty ..."", ""Just go ahead and assume that everybody is trying to kill everybody and you'll be relatively clear."", ""Thousands of rounds of ammo are spent in 2 Guns, a brutal, complicated and sporadically funny movie that still seems slight."", ""Fast pacing and a high energy level can cover a lot of sins, and nowhere is that more evident than in 2 Guns."", ""A slick, slippery thriller that taps into the anarchic playfulness that made the best American action flicks of the 1980s and '90s pop."", ""With the combined heat of its stars, \""2 Guns\"" should have had double impact, but Washington and Wahlberg are only doing this tango for cash."", ""\""2 Guns\"" feels like it's all been done before, whether by John Woo, Michael Bay or any number of their CGI-happy clones."", ""What's the old expression about putting lipstick on a pig? \""2 Guns,\"" a busy and bullet-riddled new action movie, has some mighty fine lipstick, but it's still a porker."", ""Mr. Kormakur stages a succession of action sequences that are satisfying in their own right and might be better still if they were part of a coherent whole."", ""It's a jumbled film with a lazy plot and poorly sketched action sequences, but the natural charm of its two stars, along with some colorful bit players, may put you in a forgiving mood."", ""Pure charisma is sometimes the best special effect. That's what Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg bring to 2 Guns, and after a season full of superhero duds, they deliver a crucial dose of cool."", ""It's a complete mess, the spectacle of filmmakers blowing up their movie and everything in it, because they can't think of anything else to do."", ""The Wahlberg-Washington express hits lots of comfortably familiar notes. And more than a few viciously uncomfortable ones, too."", ""You could do far worse than watch Washington and Wahlberg bicker for a couple of hours, pausing every now and then to plug somebody."", ""He has talent, this director: \""2 Guns\"" isn't necessarily my thing (the jokey sadism is a drag), but Kormakur lays out an action sequence with a swiftness and a coherence missing from many other pictures."", ""If we're being honest, Baltasar Kormakur's 2 Guns beats present-day Walter Hill at his own game."", ""I really meant to at least like 2 Guns. But I couldn't. The movie just didn't make the extra effort."", ""This is what some summer movies should be like - clever in a stupid way, and stupid in a clever way."", ""Gets us from point A to point B in a journey that, while predictable, is a breezily pleasant ride."", ""If you're craving some irresponsible and amoral old-school August cinema, with no redeeming social value beyond the message that our government has gone insane and we're all totally screwed, you won't be let down."", ""They're cute together, these two big stars, but the film around them, a sort of Tarantino lite, is desperately empty."", ""On almost every level, 2 Guns is content to be as flavorless and forgettable as its title."", ""Despite its A-list stars, \""2 Guns\"" is a subpar B-movie shoot-'em-up that's lackadaisical, cynical and slow."", ""For each amusing exchange, there's a gratuitous scene that dampens the proceedings. One of the worst involves the torture of chickens."", ""For a movie with so many dead bodies, there's still something strangely lively about \""2 Guns\"" - a film which is certainly too much, and often too confusing, but never, ever too dull."", ""Goosed along by a pulpy Elmore Leonard vibe, 2 Guns is essentially a B movie classed up by its two A-list stars."", ""Kormakur could have removed some wackiness and made a gritty action movie or toned down the viciousness and played this off for comedy, but as it is, 2 Guns is neither fish nor fowl."", ""Charm makes up for ludicrous plotting in twist-heavy crime story."", ""All you need for a movie are two guys and two guns. Unless that movie is 2 Guns, in which case you probably need a good deal more."", ""Quickly degenerates into boilerplate Hollywood sound and fury, complete with a climactic Mexican standoff that revolves around a massive, burning pile of money. Irony, thou art lost."", ""Kormakur shows he knows his way around an action movie better than most, keeping the pace quick, the banter lively and the old-school, mostly CGI-free thrills delivering right on schedule.""]"
2016: Obamas America,"[""The film is a sleepy dud, a polemic that, like D'Souza himself, is at once both outrageous and deeply boring."", ""The movie seems destined to irritate the president's supporters while mobilizing his detractors, even as it is doomed to win precious few converts.

This can be a very strange movie."", ""Every anti-Obama argument D'Souza makes from the right could be made, more forcefully, from the left."", ""D'Souza's demented anti-Obama crusade feels personal more than political."", ""A nonsensically unsubstantiated act of character assassination."", ""Presented as a conspiracy-thriller with ominous music and zig-zaggy camerawork, \""2016\"" hammers at suspicions, not issues -- a dishonorable tactic whether from the right or the left."", ""The film asks the question \""If Obama wins a second term, where will we be in 2016?,\"" then posits some disturbing answers. Disturbing, but dubious."", ""The film is not after new insight; rather, it's intent on laying out the arguments of a man who has given the same lecture countless times. That makes for a sluggish film. Even its outrage falls flat."", ""An exercise in preaching to the choir."", ""Not interviewed by the filmmakers are Obama's political supporters, but this isn't that kind of documentary."", ""While it's highly unlikely that anyone predisposed to championing Obama would be won over by the sound and fury here, there's no gainsaying the value of 2016 as a sort of Cliffs Notes precis of the conservative case against [Obama].""]"

It's irresistibly funny until it isn't."", ""It was inevitable that one of Hollywood's many recent reboots would eventually attain sentience.

They take a comedy connection that seemed doomed to fail - pairing Tatum's hunky command with Hill's nerdy neediness - and make it look like the most natural thing in the world."", ""Much of the humor involves trotting out cliches from cop movies and teen movies, then commenting on how dumb they are."", ""21 Jump Street earns my genial nod because of its limber, 120-IQ take on the whole notion of movie revivals."", ""The makers of 21 Jump Street clearly understood that almost nobody really wanted a 21 Jump Street movie, and they've cleverly used a familiar property as a way to get a wildly entertaining new comedy made."", ""Big surprise: The sometimes chaotic \""Jump Street\"" is a lot of ridic fun, as the kids say, turning predictability on its head."", ""The saving grace of \""21 Jump Street,\"" co-written and produced by Hill, is its obvious affection for teen genres, and for teenagers."", ""Even if you think you've graduated from genital jokes and violent slapstick, the laughing gas around \""21 Jump Street\"" may get you hooked."", ""Completely abandoning earnest teenagers-in-crisis melodrama in favor of crude, aggressive comedy, this \""21 Jump Street\"" is an example of how formula-driven entertainment can succeed."", ""It's mostly another raunchy buddy comedy - albeit one with welcome comic discipline, more focused on maintaining pitch than continually lowering the bar on gross-out jokes."", ""Less an adaptation than an \""adaptation\"" that delights in highlighting the ridiculous cliches and tropes it lampoons."", ""Here's the last movie I was expecting with this title. In other words, \""21 Jump Street\"" is pretty good."", ""What makes 21 Jump Street so funny and exciting and lovable is all the stuff you don't see coming."", ""What was the last stupid Hollywood comedy -- good-stupid, not stupid-stupid -- to offer actual, audible, verifiable big laughs?"", ""It's part homage and part wink at the past. It jokes about high school but is also a sensitive sociological study of those crucial years. It bridges slapstick and action. It's quick-witted with its pop references."", ""Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller get nearly everything -- the tone, the self-referential nods to the show and the dead-solid-perfect surprises -- just right."", ""Yes, there are laughs to be had here, but I wonder whether it might be more amusing to watch episodes of the old TV show."", ""Thanks to charming leads and a smattering of laughs, this is still worth a punt for fans of light buddy comedies."", ""Rather than treat the late-'80s source material as holy kitsch, the filmmakers have reconceived this tale of illegal narcotics and arrested adolescence as a viciously satirical, unapologetically crude buddy comedy."", ""This is not a property requiring respect and devotion to the source material to satisfy longtime fans, so the filmmakers wisely make a \""21 Jump Street\"" all their own."", ""Though these mismatched cops bounce well off each other, Tatum, in his first comedic lead role, is the better performer, both more riotous and affecting."", ""Not everything... works, and if you're actually looking for a consequential night at the movies you might want to stay away, but for a goofy fun Friday night this gets the job done."", ""The helmers make slick use of their new live-action collaborators. Considering that hardly anyone was asking for a 21 Jump Street reboot, they've put their own playful stamp on it."", ""Co-directors Lord and Miller keep the comic pace humming along agreeably with the same sort of animated energy they provided for those raining meatballs."", ""It has a bad, slapstick first act but by midpoint becomes strangely compelling, tapping into the fantasy of reliving one's high-school years (which did a number on us all) and getting it right.""]"
21 and Over,"[""In the end, 21 and Over is more exhausting - and exhausted - than funny or wild."", ""One of those brashly formulaic all-night-long youth-party flicks that's redeemed by the speed and personality of the actors."", ""These guys get into more trouble in one night than members of this film's target audience will encounter in their entire college lives."", ""All, or at least some, might be forgiven if there were just one likable character or memorable joke."", ""Among the ingredients \""21\"" is missing: the infectiously random silliness of a Zach Galifianakis, the smug hunkiness of a Bradley Cooper, and any sort of Vegas-y gloss whatsoever."", ""21 & Over provides lots of fun while the beer flows.

Even worse, unfunny."", ""You can't hate 21 & Over, and you can't laugh at it. The most you can do is just pity it for not being as outrageous as it thinks it is.

It knows it, you know it, and it knows that you know it.

My advice: Stick around."", ""Casting the less-than-charismatic Dorff may bolster Coppola's thesis, but it's dramatically self-defeating.
